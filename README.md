# MatrixAnalysis


MAtrix import data is a binary matrix of [4,6]. Each respondent has a profile with the domain of matrix = [0,1,0,1,1...n]. 
Script.

The complete respondent profile is segregated in 3 compartments. 

1. Meta information; speaking about features that identify the respondents background and compentence
2. Exposition of the repository in the form of a prov model. 
3. Feature exposition and selection of the features applicable to rate data quality. 

Furthermore, the output of the matrix will result in  a vector of following format: 

matrix = [0,1,0,1,1...n]. 

That comes from a format like this: 

10100010
10101011
10001010

The imported file is in the form of a .csv and if possible in the form of a tabular file.
